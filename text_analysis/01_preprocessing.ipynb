    "# Python Text Analysis: Fundamentals, Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop series, we'll establish building blocks for performing text analysis in Python. These techniques lie in the domain of *natural language processing*, where we apply computational techniques to language written by humans in order to explain some of the underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the million dollar question: How exactly do we go about performing computational methods on words?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is ultimately a question of *representations*. Text naturally is represented as words, which are understandable to humans because we have a grammatical and syntactical structure we use to extract meaning from those words. However, most machine learning and data science techniques utilize numerical methods to extract patterns from large datasets. So, we need to find a way to convert the language into a numerical representation. We'll start with this goal in mind, and demonstrate how involved this process can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start this process by first importing text into Python. Then, we'll cover a variety of preprocessing steps you might want to use before proceeding with computational methods. In the next sequence of this workshop, we'll work with the bag-of-words, or the first numerical representation of text that we'll encounter in this workshop series."

    "## Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization both refer to removing morphological affixes on words. Many words consist of a \"core\" word with a modified ending that adjusts the word's meaning in a given context. For example, the word \"grows\" is simply \"grow\" with an \"s\" added to denote a change in verb tense. In many cases, we're interested in the core content of the word. Stemming and lemmatization are the process of getting at the \"core\" of a word. This \"core\" component is often referred to as the *lemma*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is a rudimentary approach to obtaining the lemma: it simply removes an ending of a word. So, \"grows\" would be stemmed to \"grow\". The word \"running\" would be stemmed to \"run\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization is more general: it aims to find the lemma of a word, but can handle cases where stemming may not work. For example, the word \"fairies\" cannot be stemmed to the lemma, \"fairy\". So, we need additional rules - provided by lemmatization - that can appropriately turn \"fairies\" into \"fairy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "`nltk` provides many algorithms for stemming. We'll use the Snowball Stemmer, which we'll import from `nltk`. We'll also look at the Word Net Lemmatizer:"
