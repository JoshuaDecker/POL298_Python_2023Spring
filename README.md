For this independent study's "mini-projects", I completed [UC Berkeley's D-Lab](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley)'s Python lessons and assignments in:

* [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling)
* [Python Data Visualization](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Visualization)
* [Python Geospatial Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Geospatial-Data-and-Mapping-in-Python)
* [Python Web Scraping](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Web-Scraping) and [APIs](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Web-APIs)
* [Python Machine Learning](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning), and
* [Python Text Analysis](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Text-Analysis)

Each lesson and its completed exercises are saved in their respective directories of this GitHub repository.
